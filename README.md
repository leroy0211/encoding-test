# Encoding Test
Welcome to the encoding test.

The goal of this test is to finish the implementation /src so all the tests pass.

When all tests pass, 
- Turn this directory into a symfony4 flex based application (or use your favorite framework)
- Implementing a web frontend through which the user can submit a text for encoding,
- Using the implemented classes.
- The UI of the final application has to be responsive.

Show us what you can do!!

If you have any questions don't hesitate to ask!

Good luck

## Method of delivery
Give us the url to a git repo (bitbucket, github).
We want to see the process as well as the end result

## Bonus points
- Use docker for development, but not required.
- Use a CSS Preprocessor (bonus .scss) in combination with a Taskmanager (Gulp)
- UI: _Responsive_ & Mobile first
